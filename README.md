# cyclejs-examples
A collection of CycleJS examples that I have been working with.

These examples started from the excellent examples
repo [here](https://github.com/cyclejs/cycle-examples) and I have been slowly
updating them to be a bit more robust.

Currently I have updated the examples with the following.

`http-search-github`
- Added error handling to prevent errors from stopping any further requests
- Adding a loading indication when waiting for results
- Added an empty state for when the the input box is cleared
